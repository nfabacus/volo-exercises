# Volo Exercises

Site currently published at the below temporary address:
```
https://volo-api-practice.now.sh/
```
Sorry this site does not work with api as it is https.  But, the app will work on a http site and local machine.




This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
